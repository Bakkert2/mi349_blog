    <h2>About Info</h2>

    <p>My name is Tristan Bakker, and I'm an amateur game designer currently residing in East Lansing. I study game design and development, with a concentration in design, as well as an additional minor in creative writing.</p>

    <h3>I have partipated in a plethorah of activities throughout my time here at Michigan State, including:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Ultimate Frisbee</li>
        <li>Competitive Mario Kart</li>
        <li>Security for Broad Art Museum</li>
        <li>Student Supervisor for Recycling center</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Eventually, I'm hoping to become a professional game writer, and hand craft many stories for people to enjoy and potentially change someone's outlook on life, just as mine has been.</p>
