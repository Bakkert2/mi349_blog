        <h1>My name, is Tristan Bakker. And yeah. I'm pretty normal. At least I think so.</h1>
    <h2>A walk through of my day? Okay... I guess we'll do this one more time.</h2>

        <h2>I guess we'll start with the right beginning of the day.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wake up to morning alarm</li>
            <li>Check phone for notifications, answer any pressing texts or messages</li>
            <li>Get out  of bed, head to the bathroom-</li>
        </ol>

        <p>What, what, what, too boring for ya? Moving too slow? ALright alright, we can speed things up I guess. Geez, so particular.</p>

        <p>The abbreviated version then:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wake up do morning ritual</li>
            <li>Determine if I need to pack food or extra items for the day</li>
            <li><strong>Eat breakfast!</strong></li>
            <li>Pack up laptop and <em>necessary items</em></li>
            <li>Throw on shoes, walk out the door</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Look at that, we're finally out the front door. Who would have thought. In reality, this takes anywhere from 20 minutes, to 45, depending on where I'm going, and what the day is like. Somtimes I shower before class, other times I leave that for after work because of the labor and details of my job. I leave day to day.</p>
