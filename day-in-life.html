        <h1>My name, is Tristan Bakker. And yeah. I'm pretty normal. At least I think so.</h1>
    <h2>A walk through of my mornings? Okay... I guess we'll do this one more time.</h2>

    <section>
        <h2>I guess we'll start with the very beginning of the day.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wake up to morning alarm</li>
            <li>Check phone for notifications, answer any pressing texts or messages</li>
            <li>Get out  of bed, head to the bathroom-</li>
        </ol>

        <p>What, what, what, too boring for ya? Moving too slow? ALright alright, we can speed things up I guess. Geez, so particular.</p>

        <p>The abbreviated version then:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wake up, do morning ritual</li>
            <li>Determine if I need to pack food or extra items for the day</li>
            <li><strong>Eat breakfast!</strong></li>
            <li>Pack up laptop and <em>necessary items</em></li>
            <li>Throw on shoes</li>
            <li>Forget there were more items in my room that I needed to grab before walking out the door</li>
            <li>Go and grab items that I initially forgot</li>
            <li>Finally get out the door, with shoes on, and head down to the bike rack, where I will then bik to class.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Look at that, we're finally out the front door. Who would have thought. In reality, this takes anywhere from 20 minutes, to 45, depending on where I'm going, and what the day is like. Somtimes I shower before class, other times I leave that for after work because of the labor and details of my job. Regardless of the day though, I always have a bag on my back, hopefully a pep in my stride, and ready to get the day started, no matter how much caffine I'm going to need to get myself through the day.</p>
